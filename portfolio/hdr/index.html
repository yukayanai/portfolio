We shipped this application in 2019 in time for the second semester at the University. This case study focuses on the students skills assessment of the project.</p></div><div class="column width-8 offset-2 left mb-60"><p class="role"><strong>Role:</strong> UX Designer<br><strong>Methods and Tools:</strong> User Interview, Current State Analysis, Usability Testing, Optimal Workshop, Wireframing, Prototyping, Google Analytics, Adobe XD<br><strong>Team members:</strong> Stakeholders (GRE+D), Product Owner, a Scrum Master, a Business Analyst, and 3 Developers.</p></div><div class="column width-8 offset-2 left mb-60"><h2>The Problem</h2><p>GRE+D is a research student learning framework, launched by Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in 2017. They offer a number of workshops and training opportunities on campus and online for research students to attend.</p><p>Since 2017, HDR students were expected to complete a Word document where they would self assess their skills. There were about 20 skills the students would assess themselves with a rate of 1 to 5 and would record evidence of how they have achieved this level or how theyâ€™d like to improve their skills. There was no mandatory requirement to complete this form or collaborate with their supervisors. Once the student has completed the form, there was no easy way for their supervisors to track how their students are doing or to find available workshops and training to improve their skills. The awareness of the opportunities offered by GRE+D was only through emails and was not easily accessible by students. Student progress only existed in this document.</p><p>Previously, the physical skills assessment document looked like this.</p></div><div class="column width-10 offset-1 center"><img class="photo-shadow" src="/images/portfolio/hdr/pdf-assessment-ed3c819232.jpg" alt="Previous PDF skills assessment"></div></div></section></div><div class="section-block bkg-charcoal color-white"><div class="row"><div class="column width-8 offset-2 left"><h2>Research</h2><p>We conducted a workshop with 8 HDR students and a separate workshop with 5 GRE+D staff to understand some of the challenges they are facing and what they would like to see in the future. We learnt a lot! We also gathered requirements from GRE+D staff and stakeholders.</p><p>These were some of our findings:</p><ul><li>Assist students to easily find and access training and workshop opportunities to upskill</li><li>Track students progress and encourage them with regular engagement</li><li>Connect supervisors and students through the skills assessment tool</li><li>Enable to see trends and patterns of skills that students needs</li></ul></div></div></div><section class="section-block replicable-content bkg-grey-ultralight"><div class="row"><div class="column width-8 offset-2 left mb-20"><h2>Feedback & Iterations</h2><p>We also brought together the entire team to brainstorm different visuals and forms of displaying student progress, training and workshop opportunities, and self assess against the skills.</p><p>We then used an interactive prototype to test with a number of HDR students.</p></div><div class="column width-12 center mb-40"><img src="/images/portfolio/hdr/design-iteration-27d64a511f.png" alt="Design iteration wireframes"></div><div class="column width-8 offset-2 left"><p>Some of feedback from students were:</p><ul><li>What is the purpose of this tool?</li><li>How much information do I need to document?</li><li>Some of the skills examples and descriptions need to be more concrete</li></ul><p>From these initial feedback, we found that there were a lot of problems with what we have initially designed for. We went back to the drawing table, discussed and presented some of our findings and brainstormed ways we could improve this.</p><p>These were some of the improvements we were focusing on:</p><ul><li>Have a consistent student journey</li><li>Have clearer expectations for students</li><li>Improve the skill descriptions to make it clearer for students to understand without the examples</li><li>Provide examples of the experience or training for each skill that are relevant</li><li>How opportunities are displayed should make it clear to students what value they would get.</li></ul><p>We worked with GRE+D staff members and some help from the content officers to improve some of the languages used in the tool. We then updated the prototype and conducted a number of usability tests. The test was screen and voice recorded and we have analysed our findings on Optimal Workshop.</p></div></div></section><section class="section-block replicable-content"><div class="row horizon" data-animate-in="preset:slideInRightShort;duration:1000ms;" data-threshold="0.3"><div class="column width-8 offset-2 left mb-20"><h2 class="mb-30">Outcome</h2><p>After conducting many user interviews, a number of design iterations, we felt really confident about launching this to our HDR students and staff of GRE+D! This was our final design.</p></div><div class="column width-6 offset-3 center mb-40"><img class="photo-shadow" src="/images/portfolio/hdr/onboarding-ad913e476e.png" alt=""></div><div class="column width-8 offset-2 left mb-40"><h3>Onboarding</h3><p>We found from our user testing that a lot of the students didn't know what to expect and how it will help with their degree. To help solve this issue, we created an onboarding page to introduce the new online tool to first time students in the tool. This page explains how this tool works and what to expect out of the tool. It also goes through step by step process and explanation of the three research skills; Advance, Engage and Lead.</p></div><div class="column width-6 center mb-40"><img class="photo-shadow" src="/images/portfolio/hdr/engage-35feeae901.png" alt=""></div><div class="column width-6 center mb-40"><img class="photo-shadow" src="/images/portfolio/hdr/opportunities-5066cbe8d8.png" alt=""></div><div class="column width-8 offset-2 left mb-20"><h3>Rating their skills</h3><p>Previously, the students were expected to rate their skill based on 1 - 5. We found through user interviews that students found it difficult to rate themselves in this rating. So we tested with a number of different terms and we ended up with 'new to me', 'some experience', 'significant experience' and 'not relevant'. We also worked with communications offiers to simplify some of the skills names and the description text so that students understood what each skills are.</p></div><div class="column width-8 offset-2 left mb-20"><h3>Finding opportunities</h3><p>The last screen is a list of opportunities based on what they have rated themselves against each skill. It is also in order of date so that they could see upcoming training or workshops they could attend. On the left hand side is a filter option for each skill. We would like to expand on this filter for the next iteration to help them narrow their opportunities. There is an option for students to print their skills assessment so that they can see how they have progressed over the year. The students can also update their skills once they come back to the tool.</p></div><div class="column width-8 offset-2 left mb-40"><p>3 months and 6 months after the launch, I created a report on how the tool was tracking. Have there been students completing their skills assessment? Are there returning students? What might we be able to improve in the next iteration?</p></div><div class="column width-6 offset-3 center mb-60"><img class="photo-shadow" src="/images/portfolio/hdr/hdr-report-35dbf92441.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="column width-8 offset-2 left mb-40"><p>It was great to see the number of students in the tool increasing and the returning students coming back to the tool to update their skills level and finding opportunities. There were more opportunities to improve this tool however, with the time constraints we had a list of backlog items that could be reviewed next time.</p></div></div></section><div class="section-block pagination-3"><div class="row"><div class="column width-12"><ul><li><a class="pagination-previous icon-oc-angle-left" href="../openspace/" title="Previous project"></a></li><li><a class="pagination-next icon-oc-angle-right" href="../koala/" title="Next project"></a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><footer class="footer"><div class="footer-top"><div class="row flex"><div class="column width-12"><div class="widget"><p>&copy;&nbsp;<script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear())</script>&nbsp;Yuka Yanai.
